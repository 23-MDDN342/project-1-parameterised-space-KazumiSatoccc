### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

My design is inspired by flower of life. Since this project is aimed to create background for zoom, I wanted it to be less movement and details.

I've started from sketching geometric shapes because pattern is a key to feel the satisfaction.

My initial design was illusion hexagon which is hexagons in the hexagon like a matryoshka and spin them with different speed. However, I felt the movement is too fast and hexagon was too difficult to handle, so I decided to use flower of life pattern instead.

At early stage I made each ellipse disapper by making them small, but this also had too much movements to fin in 24 frames so I changed the method of disappering to changing the colour of ellipse.

Flower of life pattern is has spiritual meaning and I didn't want the shapes to be too clear so I used gradient color to make it blurry.

While I was working, I thought it looks like halo(religious iconography thing) so I positioned it to be at behind the head when it is used for zoom background.
